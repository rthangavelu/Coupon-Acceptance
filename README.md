# Coupon Acceptance 

## Overview
 The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a driver accepting a coupon, which can be useful in businesses offering promotional discounts and targeting the right drivers with the right coupons.

In the context of this project, we aim to predict whether a driver will accept or reject a coupon. The project involves analyzing various factors that could influence the decision of the driver, such as:

- **Coupon Value**: The monetary value of the coupon.
- **Driver's History**: Previous patterns in coupon acceptance or rejection.
- **Time of Day**: The time the coupon is offered.
- **Weather Conditions**: How weather might affect the decision to accept a coupon.
- **Location**: Geographical area or city where the coupon is offered.

This project is beneficial for businesses looking to optimize their promotional offers and target drivers who are more likely to accept coupons.

## Features
- Predictive model to forecast coupon acceptance
- Data preprocessing tools to clean and prepare the dataset
- Visualization tools for data exploration
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical part of Coupon Acceptance data. The following steps can be used to clean and prepare your data:

- Data Inspection: Examine the dataset to check for anomalies, missing values, and irrelevant features.
- Remove Duplicates: Remove repeated rows and entries from the dataset.
- Handling Missing Values: Handle missing data using imputation or removal.
- Noise Reduction: Use smoothing or other techniques to minimize the effect of noise.
